TASK NO:2 IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION:

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Aim is to train a model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
